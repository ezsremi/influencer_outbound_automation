# influencer_outbound_automation
Used to automate cold outbound emailing for establishing contact with influencers.

**Problem:** Influencer funnel can be broken into three main stages: Outreach, Negotiation, and Delivery. This doc is focused on stage one. The Outreach process is a numbers game, especially when expanding to new games, and is currently a bottleneck and draws time away from skilled tasks in latter stages. The current process is:
slow & requires high manual labor on low skill, autonomize-able tasks 
not optimized for multiple people to work on outreach, leading to miscommunication
**Solution:** Leverage google APIs + freelancers (optional) for low-cost automation of stage 1, freeing up time for stage 2 + 3.
